# Introduction to Microsoft Excel

Before we get started on our analysis, let's explore why we're using Microsoft Excel for our analysis and how you can use this tool in your other courses, work, and personal projects.

### **What is Excel and why should I use it?**

With so much hype around programming, machine learning, and artificial intelligence \(AI\), and, recently, some crazy cool things that GPT-3 can do, it might seem archaic to use Excel for any kind of data management or analysis, however, Excel is one of the most widely used spreadsheet software and is especially useful to visualize your raw data \(up to an extent\) before you dive into any analysis.

Excel is extremely useful for automating simple calculations, organizing and sharing data in spreadsheets, and creating dynamically updating data visualizations, tables, and other valuable data insights. You can also connect other live databases to Excel workbooks, which helps work around restricted access challenges or the need to know different programming languages \(like SQL\) to extract the data that you actually want to work with.

### Excel alternatives

GRID estimates that over [800 million people use Microsoft Excel](https://medium.com/grid-spreadsheets-run-the-world/excel-vs-google-sheets-usage-nature-and-numbers-9dfa5d1cadbd), and Microsoft reported in their Build 2016 keynote that they have [1.2 billion Microsoft Office users and 60 million Office 365 commercial customers](https://www.windowscentral.com/there-are-now-12-billion-office-users-60-million-office-365-commercial-customers). In addition, Apple’s [Numbers](https://www.apple.com/numbers/) \(iOS-based\) and Google’s [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) \(cloud-based\) are very similar spreadsheet software tools that have almost all of the same functionality of Microsoft Excel. 

### How do people in industry use Excel today?

Almost any industry that uses or tracks data will use Excel or some similar alternative spreadsheet software \(Google Sheets or Numbers\). Since all of these tools have a generally low learning curve and because they all follow the same logic and functionality, employees can easily apply their Excel skill set in one organization to another even if they are working on different subject material, and employers can save time and money on training new employees with new spreadsheet software if their hires are already familiar with how to conduct analysis or build tools in Excel from previous school, work, or project experience. 

Because of this, several industries use Excel \(or an equivalent\) in or to help with:

* **Finance and accounting**: create and monitor budgets, perform complex financial modeling
* **Data entry, storage, or sharing:** store data or share databases and working documents \(with calculations and visualizations\) with colleagues or teammates, clean up data errors or duplications and share these with collaborators, use Google Sheets for small-scale open data hosting 
* **Data analysis:** segment, rearrange, and compare data in the same or different Excel documents to draw insights about the subject matter, use formulas and pivot tables to rearrange data and quickly assess big picture findings
* **Project Management:** [Gantt charts](https://www.gantt.com/) for project management
* **Organization:** keep track of personal or organizational needs, finances, and records
* **Data Visualizations, reports, and dashboards:** bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, keep track of data in real time if connected to a live database
* **Marketing:** analyze sales and user activity, marketing mix optimization
* **Human Resources:** customer/employee churn analysis, 
* **Statistical calculations:** simple calculations in a cell \(average, standard, deviation, etc.\) in addition to larger-scale statistical analysis such as linear regression analysis, cluster analysis, etc.

### What are Excel’s limitations?

Excel can support up to [1,048,576 rows by 16,384 columns](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/excel-specifications-and-limits-1672b34d-7043-467e-8e27-269d656771c3) \(Google Sheets can only support [up to 5 million cells or 18,278 columns](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/37603)\), so it can be useful for data storage and sharing, or as a passthrough document for larger, proprietary databases\), however, when you use Excel at it capacity you run the risk of the program crashing and potentially losing your work \(!\) or working very slowly. This has started to happen to me when I do more complex calculations on Excel sheets with only 90 columns and about 90,000 rows, so even though Excel \*can\* work up to a large capacity, sometimes limitations start to manifest much sooner. 

There are several alternatives to Excel depending on what you’re trying to accomplish. Some examples are: 

* **Big Data analysis:** programming languages such as Python, R, Stata, SAS
* **Data visualizations with multiple sources:** Tableau, Plotly Chart Studio, Microsoft Power BI
* **Financial accounting:** Board, Oracle \(JD Edwards\), TM1 \(Cognos\), and Adaptive Insights
* **Project Management:** Trello, Asana \(although these have arguably different use cases than simply organizing tasks on Excel\), several proprietary Gantt chart software tools

### Data Analysis with Excel

You’ve likely used Excel before to view a dataset, to build some charts, or to conduct some higher level calculations. In our following example we’ll expand on your Excel working knowledge by exploring a real-world example of how Johns Hopkins University might want to evaluate and provide resources to support their student population diversity. Before you begin, read President Daniels’ recent [article in The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/why-we-ended-legacy-admissions-johns-hopkins/605131/?utm_source=feed) about why Johns Hopkins University decided to end legacy admissions, and how they track “success” with this decision.
