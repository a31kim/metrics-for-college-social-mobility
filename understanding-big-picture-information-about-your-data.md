# Understanding Big Picture Information about your Data

We'll start our analysis with 

Our Excel spreadsheet is made up of columns and rows, which make up a bunch of cells in the body of our Excel sheet, where we can input and manipulate data for our analyses.

If we want to get a better view of the data inside our Excel sheet, we can always zoom in or zoom out using the cursor on the bottom right corner of our spreadsheet

We also notice that our Excel sheet auto formats so that each row and column is a standard width, however, this doesn’t always show all of the information that we want to see for each row. We can manually change the width of our columns and rows by hovering over the line between the columns that we want to adjust until our cursor changes to a vertical black line with two arrows pointing to the right and left of the line. Then, we can click and drag our column to change the width of either of the columns adjacent to that line. This is helpful if we want to quickly see what’s hidden in one of our top columns, but we’re limited by what we can see in our current view. We have over 2,000 rows in this dataset, so it’d take a long time \(and would be very inefficient\) if we scrolled through to make sure that our column was properly formatted for all of our rows. We can auto-adjust our columns to perfectly fit our data in our entire column by hovering over the line in between our columns again and then double-clicking when our icon changes to the vertical line with two arrows:

We might want to know how much data we’re working with before we dive into any analysis as well. To find out how many rows our spreadsheet contains we can either scroll down to the bottom of the sheet to look at the row number, use the shortcut “COMMAND + down arrow key” on MacOS or “CTRL + down arrow key” in Windows to go to the last item in that column \(the edge of the spreadsheet\), or highlight the entire row and look at the “count” at the bottom right corner.
